# Take this paint

This is a react app that lets people give away their partial cans of paint after they've finished painting. You can anonymously post a paint, including a picture and there's also a color picker control that lets you pick a 3 (hexadecimal) digit color on a little palette.

The idea is that somebody will be able to send you a mail through Nodemailer with a randomized to and from address, like craigslist does, so the two of you can meet and you can get rid of your paint.

After I get the mail-relaying working, I plan to move from my hand-written css to tailwind. I will also get rid of the hard coded login/password values, obviously.
