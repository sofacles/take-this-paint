      <div>
        Check your email for a confirmation link and click on the link inside.
        After you confirm, we'll start show your paint on on our site. If
        somebody is interested in receiving your paint, our system will relay an
        email from them to you. We will continue to show your paint until you
        click the cancel link in the confirmation email, but we will delete it
        after a year to save space.
        <p>
          It's nice that you took the trouble to do this. If we find a recipient
          for your paint, you'll have saved some resources, saved somebody else
          some money and freed up some space in your house!{" "}
